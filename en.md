## Crying Out in the spring

In the spring of 2022, the weather is colder than usual, a concatenation of news of war, air crash, and pandemic make cold rain and spring chill more severe coursing through my body and piercing my spine. While people who are yet not lost in conscience and still have the faith in justice feel agonizing and resentful about the wretched which the shackled woman in Xuzhou is suffering from and the evil of society and humans it reflects, Russia invaded Ukraine for unreasonable cause “to purge the Nazi”, tens of thousands of people were infected with the Covid-19. Nothing but unexpected disaster interrogating how significant lives, liberty and dignity are at the time when everyone is isolated from each other came with the spring.

In early March, plenty of diagnosed patients emerged in the Changchun and Jilin city in Jilin province, some of the cases were infected in universities, then as the routine, locking down schools and markets, blocking the doors. Then the next is Shenzhen, which is just a bridge away from Hong Kong.

At the same time, at the Yangtze River inlet, Shanghai, the most developed economy and most internationalized, also one of the cities trying to escape from politics, 24,000,000 citizens were unaware of what is going to happen, like this bustling and proud city cares little about lives in Ruili, Xuzhou or Changchun and Jilin.

Soon afterward, schools were going to close offline classes, markets with the endless flow of people restarted checking travel codes strictly. Not soon after that, campuses and neighborhoods would be under closed management, everyday nucleus acid test came back, most people just had recognized things wouldn’t be such simple as usual “precise prevention and control”. Then dormitories and apartment buildings would be closed, markets and stores needed to close business, factories needed to halt production, construction of “Fangcang hospitals”( also known as “Camp”) was carried out,  eventually, no one believed in the propaganda of “materials are sufficient”, the refutation of rumor “Shanghai prohibits express delivery” also got pale: trucks were blocked in the way to Shanghai at the highway entrances, live materials would not be sufficient.

Later in March, all these measures took no effect on curbing the number of infected persons, but for frequent “nucleus acid test for all citizens” and handing large amounts of infected patients with mild symptoms even no symptoms, almost all of the medical staff were occupied; to prevent the nosocomial infection (to prevent the political effects of causing nosocomial infections), hospitals just refused to accept and treat all patients except infected with Covid-19: regardless how diseases were severe like cancer, uremia or acute like heart attack, wheeze, and pancreatitis…… Had desperate crying and bleak bloodstains put shame on the Hippocratic Oath? And also made who achieve success, praised whose “virtues”?

In April, Pudong and Puxi district was shut down one after another, I just can’t get antidepressants because I can not get out of campus, and express delivery cannot get into the city. Impacts of all the radical anti pandemic measures which shutdown supermarkets and stores, put neighbors under close management, and denied deliveries appeared: common starvation, starvation happening in the most economically developed city of China. At the same time, “selfless” volunteers, “conscientious” service personnel, and resident committees staffs just turned a blind eye to starving neighbors and just eating their rations, or even worse,  beat up “dodgy people” who “ignored the control” and selling or buying living materials with “malice” just in sake of survival.

Lack of living materials? Maybe the shortage is not such severe: goods from other cities piled up in the repositories of government and residents committees,  but few of them were actually delivered to citizens: most citizens just get “Lianhua Qingfei Capsule” or vegetables which have no differences from wet waste or nothing. And some goods went to markets with labels of blessing words like “hope for pandemic soon ends”, others even were exterminated with repositories “accidentally caught fire”……

During three years of famine and the “Cultural Revolution (文化大革命)”, there were quantities of starving people died in front of granaries of government, with the firm faith that “Chairman Mao” would save them until the last moment.

Shanghai, formerly the facade of prosperity and civilization, finally became the loincloth not able to cover all the shame anymore. The city with the hypocritical spirit, today had no difference from concentration camps with humanitarian disasters happening consistently.  The city trying to escape from politics had been involved in the most ridiculous and cruel political campaign, the man hoping to live without caring for others and the evil of public power, cannot pretend to be blind and deaf anymore.

The “Dynamic zeroing (动态清零)” and “Anti-pandemic measures” had metamorphosed into a political campaign out of control like the “Cultural Revolution”, caused by the will of the “supreme leader” and also become a man-made disaster: the Leviathan kills people cruelly. Who boasts “Life First”, putting up innumerable obstacles for people, illegal detaining people, assaulting people and making hospitals unable to save people, Embezzling disaster relief supplies…… All the evil deeds become positive and will be praised, as long as it stands for “the nation”, “the anti-pandemic measures” and once rascals and bandits wear white uniforms and armbands, they become “selfless volunteers” everyone should be grateful for.

Did patients get treatment? If being restricted in “Fangcang hospitals” (the camp which is still under construction and even will leak when it rains) and taken no care can be called “treatment”, newborns forced to be separated from their parents with crying and heartbroken can be called “treatment”, maybe it is true.

For who is directing the campaign and who is just simply carrying out tasks, all these are generally fine; starvation, desperate crying, and evil deeds happening far away are just “insignificant prices” for those who turn a blind eye and a deaf ear on everything. I am unable to find a brighter future, the only thing I could see is tragedy and atrocities.

A natural disaster will end but man-made disasters won’t stop, the “Cultural Revolution” came to an end because the “supreme leader” died, not for people cannot stand anymore. I could do nothing but be resentful, crying out, praying, being restricted on campus, in the dormitory I am in no position to do anything. I cannot stand up and all others for resistance, compared to threats like discipline, being dropped from school, or even being convinced, I am more afraid of what I do just get ignorance, contempt even scolding: these will make me more hopeless. I am just a coward, cannot be a martyr like Bruno or Copernicus, neither can I be a recorder of the times like Solzhenitsyn or Lu Xun for I am not skilled in writing. I am just an unqualified and physically and mentally unhealthy university student, writing awful articles not flowing well to vent the pain of my conscience which is still intact.

 Please allow me to escape until finding somewhere I can cry loudly for wretched, please allow words to live longer, so I can wait for the dawn in my dream.

Now crying for separation of parents and children, separation of life and death, starvation, the pain of slight illness is still coming from families, echoing and wandering in the night sky. I can’t do anything for them and just sigh and cry, tears dissipate immediately.
